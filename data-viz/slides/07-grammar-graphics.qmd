## What is the grammar of graphics? {.smaller}

* A way of describing a visualization 

  * Data
  * Mapping from data to aesthetic features
  * Geometry
  * Scales
  * Facets
  * Statistics
  * Coordinates
  * Themes
  
## What is the grammar of graphics?

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L07/ggplot-layers.png")
```

## Data

We will use "tidy data" arranged in a table

  * columns are variable
  * rows are observations

This arrangement makes it easy to use one variable for each aesthetic feature of a plot (axis position, colour, facet, text labels, ...)


## Aesthetic mappings {.smaller}

We map variables to features of the graph

  * x, y axis position
  * colour (outline, fill)
  * symbol shape, size
  * line type
  * error bars
  * many more used less frequently, depending on the geometry

Discrete and quantitative variables are handled the same way. The details of the scale and geometry will determine their interpretation.

## Scales

* Range of values on x or y axis; formatting of axis labels

* Mapping from values to a discrete or continuous colour scale; choice of colours

* Mapping from values to a shape, or line thickness, or symbol size


## Geometry

What kind of plot do you want?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L07/geoms-1.png")
```
:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L07/geoms-2.png")
```
:::
::::



## Facets

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("static/L07/ggplot-facet.png")
```


## Statistics & Coordinates {.smaller}

* Do you want to perform calculations on your data before plotting?

  * Calculate average and standard deviation
  * Smooth data
  * Add a regression line
  
* What coordinate system do you want to use?

  * Cartesian (x-y)
  * Polar (r, $\theta$)
  * Map projections


## Annotation & Theme

All the "non-data ink":

* Titles, axis labels, tick marks
* Background shading, box around plot
* How and where the legend (colour, shape) is displayed
* Other annotations - shading, text

## Summary

- The grammar of graphics is a way of describing a visualization. 

- `ggplot2` is a computer implementation of this idea.

- Other implementations are available for python (plotnine), javascript (D3), julia (Gadfly).


## Suggested reading

* Course notes

## Self-quiz 

Aesthetics are mappings between variables in your dataset and your visualization, defined using the `aes` function.

Which of the following is a possible aesthetic mapping for the `gapminder` data set?

1. `aes(country = x, pop = y)`
2. `aes(x = country, y = pop)`
3. `aes(x <- country, y <- pop)`

## Self-quiz 

The geometry (or geom) of a plot determines how the data are displayed in your visualization. 

Select the true statement.

1. You can have only one geometry, such as `geom_point` per plot
2. You can use mutiple geoms per plot, for example combining both `geom_plot` and `geom_line`.


## Self-quiz 

True or false: To change all the points in a scatterplot to red circles, you need to add variables to your data frame with values "red" and "circle" and map those variables to the colour and shape aesthetic.
